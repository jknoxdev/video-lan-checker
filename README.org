** series of scripts to aid the security camera installer
   -[[https://github.com/jknoxdev/video-lan-checker/tree/main/incubator#7seg][7seg]]: displays a 7seg window on a device for camera monitoring

   - [[./scanner.py][scanner]] - scans the network and draws a cluster diagram

   - installation: 
     "normal" python environment
     begin by placing in to it's own venv: 

     | bash/zsh   | $ source <venv>/bin/activate      |
     | fish       | $ source <venv>/bin/activate.fish |
     | csh/tcsh   | $ source <venv>/bin/activate.csh  |
     | PowerShell | $ <venv>/bin/Activate.ps1         |

     then, lets setup the environment:

     #+begin_src sh :results output raw
     pip3 install matplotlib
     pip3 install pythonping
     pip3 install scapy
     pip3 install network
     #+end_src

     #+begin_src sh :results output raw
     sudo python scanner.py
     #+end_src
     - v0.01 - gets root, asks user for /24 ip range, draws the diagram, runs in parallel, does dns resolve for ips found, drops to layer 2 for unknowns



   - [[./src/plotter.py][harry_plotter]]
     - (make sure to run as root!) plots the ip addresses found on the network and shows each of the traffic types being generated.
       #+begin_src sh :results output raw
       python ./src/plotter.py
       #+end_src
       [[img/hp_scr001.png]]
     - checks for and plots all encrypted video traffic
   - [[./src/arp_scan.py][arp_scan]]
     - continuosly monitors network via wlan1 for any new arp traffic (usefull if you're plugging in cameras and want to see if they come up)
     - v 0.01 - built from example code, future versions should include:
       - OEM name tracking
       - previously seen list
       - menu
         - option to select from most common networks, 192.168.1.0/24, etc.
         - options to save to csv
       - timestamp for "last seen"

 - not-running:
   - plot_traff.py
   - test_scapy.py
   - running_man.py
     - rogue DHCP server checker.. shows packts for BS networks being broadcast on L2.
